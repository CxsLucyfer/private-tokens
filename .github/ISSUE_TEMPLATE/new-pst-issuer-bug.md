Disclosure & Acknowledgement:

1. I understand the technical restrictions on key rotation frequency of 60 days in the PST API.
2. I understand that my issuer registration will be valid for a period of six months after the key commitment is accepted, and that I will need to re-register in this repository following that six-month period.
3. I understand that in the future renewing my registration for this API may have additional requirements, to reduce the risk of abuse by token issuers.
